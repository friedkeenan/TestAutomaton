# TestAutomaton

A cellular automaton I made because I was bored. It fills the screen with random colors, with some black padding on the top, and then when the cell reproduces, it picks a random spot directly next to it, and if the cell has more or equal to strength (how far the brightness of the color is from 127.5, floored) than the cell where it's trying to stick its kid, its kid will go there, if not then nothing happens.

Controls:
- Press R to reset
- Click anywhere to change the size of the black buffer
